    <h1 id="rest">REST</h1>
<p>Having written a few client programs for interacting with different RESTful APIs, I wanted to learn more about how they work and implement one myself. “REST” is a software architecture that was described by Roy Fielding in <a href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/fielding_dissertation_2up.pdf">Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architectures</a>. Some of the main characteristics of such an architecture are statelessness, a uniform interface and a client-server relationship. “RESTful” APIs are usually public-facing interfaces that allow HTTP clients to make requests and manipulate resources via Create, Read, Update and Delete operations, inspired by the architectural constraints defined by Fielding. I have done some more research into this topic recently. <a href="https://twobithistory.org/2020/06/28/rest.html">There is a good post here</a> that discusses the concept of RESTful APIs as they are known by software developers, in relation to the original paper. The essence is that the term and the architectural pattern itself have been overused somewhat, and the original paper doesn’t actually have that relation to what we now associate “REST” with. I will stick with referring to this type of API as “RESTful” since I think it’s a more honest term.</p>
<h1 id="the-go-programming-language">The Go Programming Language</h1>
<p>One of the aspects that drew me to learning Go was my growing interest in backend web development. Compared to other commonly used languages like python (which I already had a decent amount of experience with), I felt that there were some particular advantages to Go for this purpose:</p>
<ul>
<li>Good standard library for web development, e.g. the net/http package</li>
<li>Strong, static typing and good development tools</li>
<li>High level of performance</li>
<li>Being a fairly new language with lots of growth and opportunities</li>
</ul>
<p>Since I had a background in C++, it was very straightforward to pick up and start learning through writing code. So far, I am enjoying using the language, particularly how simple it is, and the level of productivity you can achieve with it. That being said, the simplicity can be a curse in itself as well. Famously, Go lacks generics, which is quite hard to get used to coming from C++. Gradually, I am learning how best to use language features like interfaces to manage complexity in Go programs in different ways.</p>
<h1 id="http-routing-approaches">HTTP Routing Approaches</h1>
<p>An important aspect of a RESTful service is providing HTTP methods at various URL endpoints, to manipulate resources. <a href="https://benhoyt.com/writings/go-routing/">This article on HTTP routing in Go</a> was very useful in assessing the options available. It describes a few interesting approaches using the Go standard library, as well as introducing certain external libraries specifically created for this purpose. Eventually, I decided to adapt <a href="https://github.com/go-chi/chi/tree/master/_examples/rest">the following example from the go-chi library</a>.</p>
<h1 id="the-code">The Code</h1>
<p>Much of the work was done already in the example code, but I had make a few modifications to structure it in a more modular fashion, and store data persistently in a postgresql database rather than in the program’s memory. This was simple, albeit it took some time to understand what the go-chi library was doing and carry out all the refactoring. Managing access to the database without relying upon a globally available object was one of the challenges. For a small program, storing the object as a global variable is probably fine, and keeping to the spirit of Go by keeping things as simple as possible. That being said, I wanted to try and do things differently. Since the HTTP handler functions need to have a specific function signature, it was not as simple as passing a reference to the database object around as a function argument.</p>
<p>The approach I went with was to create a new “ArticleEnv” struct type that contained the database as a member (via a more abstract “DataStore” type), and then implement the handler functions as methods of that type. With this simple example, the approach is somewhat convoluted since the data store is the only member of the ArticleEnv type, but a more complicated application may require additional values used by the handler functions.</p>
<p>The repository for the project can be found <a href="https://github.com/risset/go-rest-api">here</a>. I will be using it as a template to refer back to when I need to implement similar functionality in future programs.</p>
