    <h1 id="why">Why?</h1>
<p>I never saw much point in blogging before since I’ve always been a pretty introverted person who tends to keep my thoughts to myself. Recently I’ve decided to be more open about things, picking up some new skills and sharing what I learn with others. It would be good to have a place on the internet that I can show to people, and demonstrate projects and other stuff.</p>
<h1 id="how">How?</h1>
<p>I am currently using a basic system of converting Emacs org-mode files to HTML with org-publish and styling them with CSS. I don’t have much of a background in frontend web development so things are going to be quite simple in that department (which is how I like it anyway). Another reason I wanted to create the site besides the aforementioned reasons is that I’ve been interested in improving my basic skill in that area, even though frontend isn’t what my main focus is as a programmer.</p>
<p><strong>21/10/20 Update</strong>: I’ve switched to using the Hakyll static web framework now. My system is still fairly similar, using Emacs org-mode as the markup language, but now things are a bit more flexible and less ad-hoc. I should be able to add new features to the site more easily this way.</p>
<h1 id="plans">Plans</h1>
<p>I was intending to make a longer post that would go into some things that I have been exploring recently related to Linux and Emacs, but it was taking a while and I wanted to focus on getting the basics of the site finished first, using a shorter initial post to test it. In the future, I plan to post fairly frequently. Most of the content will be about various programming projects I’m working on and topics I’m learning about, some of which hopefully will be useful or interesting to people stumbling upon the site.</p>
